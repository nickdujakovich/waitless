CS441 Software Engineering Final Project

This project will help people who hate or just dislike waiting in lines at any restaurant they go to. With this app waiters will become irrelevant since the guest will be able to seat themselves and also order food without the need of anyone being there physically. This will also help people when they go out in a group because everyone will also be able to individually pay for the food that they ordered. It will also benefit the restaurant by allowing them to save money on costs. This will allow for higher wages for the remaining staff and cheaper food cost for the customers.

Our initial name for the project was HostNoMore but we decided later on to change it to Waitless.
First commit message should say CS441 instead of CS433.
